The Real Problem They Solve
👉 JavaScript is Asynchronous by Nature

In web apps, many tasks take time:

Fetching data from API

Reading files

Database queries

Uploading images

Waiting for user input

If JavaScript waited for each task to finish before continuing, your app would freeze.

So JavaScript uses asynchronous programming.
